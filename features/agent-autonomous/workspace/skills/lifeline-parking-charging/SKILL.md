# LifeLine parking & charging

## When to activate

- "How many EV chargers are available?"
- "Car parks near Greenford station"
- "Is EV charging stressed right now?"
- Parking/charging leg of a multimodal journey

## Procedure (slim MCP — default)

1. Start with `lifeline_ops__get_parking_and_charging_snapshot` or read counts from briefing.
2. For EV stress detail → `lifeline_ops__get_ev_charge_summary`.
3. Report from tool fields:
   - **EV**: `available`, `charging`, `out_of_service`, `total_connectors`
   - **Car parks**: `total_car_parks`, `total_listed_spaces`, `live_occupancy_api_status`

## Full MCP mode (NEMOCLAW_SLIM_MCP=false)

Use `tfl_london__*` tools:

| Need | Tool |
|------|------|
| Filter available connectors | `get_ev_charge_connectors(status='Available')` |
| Single connector | `get_ev_charge_connector` |
| Car park list | `list_tfl_car_parks` |
| Park at station | `get_stop_car_parks` with **Naptan** id (`940GZZLUxxx`, not hub id) |
| Tariffs / hours | `get_car_park_detail` |

## Known TfL limits

- `GET /Occupancy/ChargeConnector` — **live** ✅ (~349 connectors)
- `GET /Occupancy/CarPark` — **HTTP 500** on TfL side ❌
- Car park **metadata** via `Place/Type/CarPark` — **live** ✅ (58 sites, 8340 spaces)

## Output format

- State live vs metadata-only data honestly
- If EV availability ratio < 30%, flag as operational stress
- Note car parks are directory metadata unless occupancy API recovers

## Smoke test (no LLM)
