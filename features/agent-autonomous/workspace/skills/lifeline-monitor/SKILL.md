# LifeLine monitor

## When to activate

- "Monitor London" / "watch transport"
- Heartbeat or cron-driven status checks
- "What should we investigate next?"
- Demo: autonomous ops controller loop

## Procedure

1. Call `lifeline_ops__get_london_city_briefing`.
2. Compare against prior context (session memory or `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` if present).
3. Flag **only material changes**: new line disruptions, congestion spike, EV outage cluster, new street closures.
4. If nothing material changed and this is a heartbeat → reply `HEARTBEAT_OK` (one line) unless the user asked for a full report.
5. Otherwise output **Situation → Impact → Evidence → Recommended actions** (top 3 investigations).

## Thresholds (triage hints)

| Signal | Investigate when |
|--------|------------------|
| Tube lines not good service | ≥ 1 line → note equity_impact wards |
| Congested corridors | ≥ 5 serious → `lifeline_ops__get_all_road_status` |
| Street closures | ≥ 10 closed/restricted → `lifeline_ops__get_street_disruptions` |
| EV out of service | ≥ 15 or >10% of total → `lifeline_ops__get_ev_charge_summary` |

## Do not

- Invent delays or counts from memory
- Repeat identical briefing calls in the same turn
- Claim car park bay occupancy is live (TfL `Occupancy/CarPark` often HTTP 500)
