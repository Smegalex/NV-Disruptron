# NV-Disruptron OpenClaw skills

Workspace skills teach the **disruptron** agent how to run autonomous London mobility workflows. Each skill is a folder with `SKILL.md` (YAML frontmatter + procedure).

OpenClaw loads these on session start from `features/agent/workspace/skills/`. After adding or editing skills:

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
openclaw skills list
```
