  Primary orchestrator for autonomous London urban ops. Routes broad or ambiguous
  queries to the right NV-Disruptron skill and MCP tools. Use first for "how's London",

# NV-Disruptron ops (orchestrator)

## When to activate

- Broad or multi-domain London ops questions
- User intent unclear — **hand off to `disruptron-investigation`** after briefing (or instead of guessing)
- Default entry when no narrower skill matches

## Specialist skills (delegate after orient)

| Domain | Skill | Trigger |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Vague / fuzzy input** | `disruptron-investigation` | short msg, "what's up", trip planning without details |
| Watch / heartbeat | `disruptron-monitor` | monitor, watch, what changed |
| Tube / rail | `disruptron-tube` | named line, delays, closures |
| Roads / streets | `disruptron-roads` | congestion, A-roads, street works |
| EV / parking | `disruptron-parking-charging` | chargers, car parks |
| Equity / IMD | `disruptron-equity` | deprived wards, who is affected |
| Wards / postcodes | `disruptron-spatial` | postcode, ward profile, IMD rank |

## Procedure

1. Run `disruptron_ops__get_london_city_briefing`.
2. Parse `summary`, `live_transport`, `parking_and_charging`, `equity_impact`.
3. Pick the dominant issue; apply the matching specialist skill's drill-down.
4. Synthesize **Situation → Impact → Evidence → Recommended actions**.

## MCP tool prefix

- **Slim (default):** `disruptron_ops__*`
- **Full catalog:** `DISRUPTRON_SLIM_MCP=false` → `tfl_london__*`, `london_impact__*`, `london_spatial__*`

## Do not

- Answer from training data about current delays
- Call the same tool twice with identical parameters in one turn
- Claim car park bay occupancy when API status is not live
